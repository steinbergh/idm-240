                Over the past six years, a massive cultural shift has occurred. It's changed how we interact with one another. Learn new things. Entertain ourselves. Do our work. And live our lives. All because of developers and the apps they create.
            </p>

            <p>
                For five days, one thousand Apple engineers and five thousand developers will gather together. And life will be different as a result.
            </p>

                Write the code. Change the world.
