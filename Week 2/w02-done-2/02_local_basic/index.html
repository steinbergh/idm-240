			<p>The origins of the banana are as complex and convoluted as the nature of the bananaâ€™s taxonomic origins themselves.  Archeologists have focused on the Kuk valley of New Guinea around 8,000 BCE (Before Common Era) as the area where humans first domesticated the banana.  Additionally, though this is the first known location of banana domestication, other spontaneous domestication projects may have occurred throughout the Southeast Asia and the South Pacific.  Therefore, Kuk is the first known instance of banana domestication, but it is probably not the cradle from which all other domesticated species sprang.</p>
			<p>From New Guinea, the Kuk domesticated variety appears to have spread to the Philippines, and then radiated widely across the tropics.  Researchers find it difficult to trace the diffusion of the banana after its arrival in the Philippine islands, and in many cases, it appears the banana was introduced into areas only to be reintroduced, and in a sense, rediscovered, hundreds or thousands of years later.  Adding to the confusing tangle of banana proliferation is the parallel development of hybrid fruits.  Human ingenuity manipulated the seedless, and thus asexual, forms of domesticated bananas into hybrids by careful techniques of culling and planting that fused and refined different domesticated varieties.  Thus, the origins of the banana have been difficult at best to pinpoint.  In general, however, it can be said that bananas originated in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific around 8,000 to 5,000 BCE.</p>
